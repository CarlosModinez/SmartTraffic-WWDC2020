 Hitchhikers and hitchhikers can help a lot in reducing traffic in large cities, since the car that would carry only one person, can now be fully occupied, thus reducing the number of cars that will be circulating on the streets.

 How about adding a little charity in our city and offering that ride to the neighbors?
