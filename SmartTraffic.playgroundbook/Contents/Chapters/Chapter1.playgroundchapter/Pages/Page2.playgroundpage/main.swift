# Bikes
 
 What do you think of knowing a little more about getting around with bicycles?

 The bicycle can be a good alternative when you want to travel short distances, such as when you go to work or school. In addition to being a cheap means of transportation, you can improve your health by doing a little more exercise.

 You can add bicycles in the next city and help the inhabitants of it.
